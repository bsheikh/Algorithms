# Algorithms

This repository contains my solution for some common algorithms. These algorithms will be implemented in multiple languages. Every solution will be tested before being pushed and will add more solutions to it when i have more time.

### Desirable Algorithm Characteristics

* Correctness
	- Incorrectness is shown with one counter-example
	- Correctness can only be determined with a proof
* Efficiency
	- Time Efficiency: 	Speed of the algorithm
	- Space Efficiency:	Memory space used by algorithm
