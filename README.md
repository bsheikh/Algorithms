# Algorithms

This repository contains my solution for some common algorithms. These algorithms will be implemented in Java, Python and C. Every solution will be tested before being pushed and will add more solutions to it when i have more time.

#### Desirable Algorithm Characteristics

* Correctness
	- Incorrectness is shown with one counter-example
	- Correctness can only be determined with a proof
* Efficiency
	- Time Efficiency:  Speed of the algorithm
	- Space Efficiency: Memory space used by algorithm

## Summary of Topics
We describe the major parts of algorithms, giving specific topics covered and an indication of our general orientation towards the material. This repository is intended to touch on as many fundamental algorithms as possible.

### Sorting
Rearranging arrays in order are of fundamental importance. We consider a variety of algorithms in considerable depth, including insertion sort, selection sort, shellsort, quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort.


## TODO

### Searching

### Graphs

### Strings
